# React-form

Registration form for one page with its respective validations. In the form you can return to modify the information, even if you have already advanced!

## Content

In this project, a registration form was implemented for a page (in this case a movie page), in which the user can return to modify previously completed information, even if the user is at a more advanced stage in the registration of the form. and even then the form will store and allow the information to be modified. A registration control was also simulated, an option to log in if you already have an account and an option to recover the password.
